# Virtual Reality used for medical purposes
Virtual Reality is used in medical situations where trainee doctors can learn and adapt to certain situations with the help of the virtual reality  simulation so they can get used to what surgery entails 

These Simulation allows people to prepare for risky events in safe environment. It recreates conditions that closely resemble reality, while removing any danger. It means that when people confront a similar environment in a real situation, they do so with the experience of detailed rehearsal. It is widely used in aviation, the military, and in medicine.
A lot of medical professionals would be interested in using VR as a medical training solution. In fact, most of these professionals agree that VR engagement can be more valuable than websites and other clinical tools used for patient education.

Medical VR technologies can help provide both training to HCPs as well as helping to provide better care advice through the use of apps. Moreover, these VR tools can help to educate patients on how to use drugs or help sales reps to show and sell their medical product.

Virtual reality is a new technology that has been widely used in the health field in recent years and it is applied in a wide range of diseases. In fact, this technology is the simulation of the peripheral world through a computer as well as communication through a receiver. Virtual reality consists of output tools (vision, hearing, tactile and power transmitter), input devices (mouse, chaser, gloves, etc.), a virtual environmentâ€™s graphical manufacturing system as well as an information software.

# Virtual reality: A medical training revolution during COVID-19
The pandemic has also drastically limited the scope for surgical training. Usually, trainees develop skills by watching mentors. The tests or surgeries are either performed on a live patient or a cadaver. This procedure is not only time-consuming but also risky. The outbreak has also caused an indefinite delay to all the elective surgeries further shrinking the chances of in-person surgical training. 

In such a crisis, VR is offering a safe learning environment that can be created for trainee surgeons. These virtually simulated operating rooms can help trainees learn the right techniques and skills, gain valuable experience, and build confidence while constantly receiving feedback from the seniors. Performing surgery on a virtual patient in a simulated environment enables the trainee doctors to apply newly acquired techniques without causing harm to patients or exposing them to the highly contagious virus. 
VR also has shown effectiveness in ensuring patient safety during surgeries. According to a recent study, VR training could improve patient outcomes by 83% as demonstrated during a hip arthroscopy in a randomised controlled trial.

Another serious impediment to the training procedure is the inability to create a high-stress environment that is close to reality. With stakes so high, one cannot fully recreate the stress of real surgical practice during training, but with VR, creating such a high stress yet safe environment seems highly plausible.


# is it used in  pharmaceutical sectors?

Medical Virtual reality in pharmaceutical sectors will allow the users to dive into a virtual world where they get an immersive experience to understand complex medical information. 
These VR medical applications could help improve care and outcomes for patients and better communication of therapy options for companies, healthcare professionals and research groups. Creating a new way to visualize and feel what is science and explain healthcare is one of the best added value that medical virtual reality companies can provide to their clients.
